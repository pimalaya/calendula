//! # Pimdir client
//!
//! calendula's wrapper around [`io_pimdir`]'s reader and producer
//! roles. The store belongs to the sync engine, not to calendula.
//!
//! Reads go through [`PimdirReader`], which takes no lock (pimdir SPEC
//! 8) and carries no write, so a sync in flight neither blocks calendula
//! nor is blocked by it. Writes go through [`PimdirProducer`], which
//! takes the shared lock for one enqueue and never mutates the index.
//!
//! The reader folds the queue's pending actions over the committed rows
//! (pimdir SPEC 15.4), so an action this process staged reads back
//! before the store's owner applies it.
