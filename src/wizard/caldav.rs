//! CalDAV wizard.
//!
//! Two entry points, one per way the endpoint became known. A discovery
//! entry pins the context root and the advertised methods, so
//! [`configure_discovered`] prompts only what is left.
//! [`configure_manual`] handles a typed server URL, where nothing is
//! advertised and the authentication scheme is prompted too.
//!
//! Neither connects: the wizard validates the whole account once, at
//! the end, and the runtime walks the principal and calendar home-set
//! from the stored `server`.
