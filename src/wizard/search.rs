//! # Service discovery
//!
//! Input-driven discovery for the wizard. The typed address or domain feeds
//! io-pim-discovery's parallel search (fixed provider rules, PACC, Mozilla
//! autoconfig, and the RFC 6764 CalDAV resolve).
//!
//! Every reachable service becomes one selectable entry carrying the
//! authentication capabilities it advertised; the concrete method is picked
//! once the service is chosen, so a service appears exactly once.
//!
//! calendula speaks one calendar protocol over the network, so the surface is
//! narrow: one entry per CalDAV context root. It still earns its place, being
//! what turns an email address into a server nobody had to know.
