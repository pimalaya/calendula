# Configuration of calendars relying on the CalDAV protocol, as
# defined in [RFC4791].
#
# [RFC4791]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4791

# There is 3 ways to find a CalDAV calendar home URI:
#
# 1. By using HTTP discovery, as defined in the Well Known RFC8615
# 2. By using the root CalDAV server URI
# 3. By using directy the CalDAV calendar home set URI
#
# The first method is the slowest because it requires a couple of HTTP
# requests to get the calendar home URI, but it the safest because the
# URI should never change.
#
# The third method is the fastest because it requires only one single
# HTTP request, but it is the least safe because URI can change
# anytime.
#
# The second method can be a good compromise between speed and safety.

# To discover the CalDAV calendar home URI, only the host name is
# required.
#
caldav.discover.host = "example.org" 
#caldav.discover.port = 443
#caldav.discover.scheme = "https"

# The root CalDAV server URI, which should contain all the users'
# calendars.
#
#caldav.server-uri = "https://caldav.example.org"

# The CalDAV calendar home URI, which should contain all your
# calendars.
#
#caldav.home-uri = "https://caldav.example.org/principals"

# The plain authentication method (not safe).
#
#caldav.auth = "plain"

# The Basic access authentication method.
#
caldav.auth.basic.username = "username"
caldav.auth.basic.password.command = ["pass", "show", "example"]
#caldav.auth.basic.password.keyring = "example-basic"
#caldav.auth.basic.password.raw = "password"

# The Bearer token authorization method, mainly for OAuth 2.0 usage.
#
#caldav.auth.bearer.command = ["ortie", "token", "show"]
#caldav.auth.bearer.keyring = "example-bearer" 
#caldav.auth.bearer.raw = "oauth2-token"
